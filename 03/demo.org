** TODO Net present value calculation
   - [[./npv.jpg][NPV formula]]

   - Program takes the following inputs:::
     - Enter the initial investment, c0
     - Enter the cash inflow at year1, c1
     - Enter cash incremental flow from year2 onwards, d
     - Number of years the project will run, n
     - NPV = -c0 + (c1) / (1+n/100) + (c1+d) / (1+n/100) ^ 2 
            + (c1+2d) / ( 1+n/100 ) ^ 3 and so on upto n years...
  
** TODO Internal rate of return calculation
*** What discount rate will be needed to produce an NPV of 0 for the project
