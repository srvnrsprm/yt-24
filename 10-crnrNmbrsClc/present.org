* Exercise 1
** Extract first & last numbers from a string
   - Say the input is 1abc2, pick the first number 1 & last number 2 and the result is 12
   - For trebu7chet, the first number & last number both are 7, the result is 77
   - Use the inbuilt Regex( OriginalString, ToReplace, ReplaceWith, Flags )

* Exercise 2
** Extract numbers both in numeral and word forms
   - 21nine, here the first number is 2, last number is 9 (notice the word nine)
   - We write calc function PickNmbr to do this work:
     - InStr( start, OriginalString, SearchString) => this inbuilt function will assist us 
       in searching for the pattern in the original string.
       It searches for the `SearchString` in `OriginalString` starting from the index 
       `start` and returns the index at which it finds the match.
